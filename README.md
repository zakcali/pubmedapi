# pubmedapi
get document info from pubmedapi if PMID is known

Asks pubmedid from user,
prints document info 

you may get if you query more than 3 per second "{"error":"/lbsm/eutils_lb -> Neg","api-key":"xx.yy.zz.abb","type":"ip",
"status":"ok"}"
to be able to query limit to 10 per second you must get an api which is freely available, please read: https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/11/02/new-api-keys-for-the-e-utilities/

There are both php and javascript code to fetch from publons api.
it will be wise to use an api-key for php code at line:

    $postText="&api_key=Your-API-KEY";

javascript code works from browser, so api-key maynot be necessary. Also your api key must not be visible on other users web browser

you can try those pmid's, some are challenging

to-do: Some of the abstracts may be incomplete. It seems not so important.
